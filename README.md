Context
Fantasy Premier League(FPL) is a points-based game where you select a team consisting of players in the English Premier League(top division football league in England) based on certain constraints like budget etc., and your team accumulates points depending on the real world performance of players each gameweek.

Selecting a well-scoring team while spending as little as possible is a daunting task for many, even if they watch football regularly. This is mostly because the points system is purely based on stats, which are often hidden behind the actual performance of the player. That is, just because a player is effective in a game does not mean that the player accumulates good FPL points in the game.

I am going to attempt to build a solution using a clustering-based approach to group players into different categories and ultimately to suggest the most cost-effective team each gameweek based on the the players' previous performances in a season.

A more real world application of such a solution would be in actual sports clubs where identifying players with high potential and signing them for a cost as low as possible is very crucial to the long term success of the team not just on the pitch, but on the business side as well.

Objective
The objective of this project is to try and use various clustering techniques to group players based on the FPL dataset and identify a cost-effective team.
